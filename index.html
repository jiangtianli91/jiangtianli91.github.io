    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Psychology at the University of Toronto Scarborough. My main interest lies in the nature of semantic knowledge that humans use to understand language, with a particular focus on polysemy and lexical ambiguity. Currently, I am working on various aspects of ambiguous words using computational models. In addition, I am exploring issues in the philosophy of science and meta-science, particularly the problem of generalization from stimuli samples to populations.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my PhD in philosophy, I was initially trained as a philosopher of language and worked in formal semantics and pragmatics. Over time, I also became involved in psycholinguistics and computational linguistics. This interdisciplinary experience enabled me to explore semantics from multiple perspectives. As a result, I aim to bridge these fields by using behavioral experiments and computational modeling to test different theories of semantics and pragmatics in philosophy, while also integrating experimental and computational findings into more philosophically informed work. My long-term goal is to leverage my interdisciplinary background to advance a scientific understanding of language and cognition, supported by contemporary philosophical theorizing, and to foster interdisciplinary collaboration across different areas of language research.
